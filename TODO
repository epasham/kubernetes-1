Redis:
Reference:
(1) https://github.com/sanderploegsma/redis-cluster
(2) https://rancher.com/blog/2019/deploying-redis-cluster/ which basically uses (1)

Issues:
(1) Race condition:
    fix-ip.sh, which is mounted from the configmap, when runs, cluster configuration file "/data/nodes.conf" is not created / populated
    by the pod *yet*
(2) IPv6:
    cluster configuration file "/data/nodes.conf" has :0 in the same line which contains "myself". So the regular expression in fix-ip.sh
    has to capture that pattern
